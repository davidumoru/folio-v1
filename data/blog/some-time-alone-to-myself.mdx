I try to have moments alone to myself everyday. As someone who's naturally introverted, I need that time away to disconnect from the noise and distractions of the world and connect with myself, a time to recharge and rejuvenate.
I think a lot of people, non- introverts, don't actually realise how much energy it takes just for simple things in us to get along...
And that can be really draining sometimes.
Time alone to myself is essential for my mental, emotional, and physical well-being.

I really am grateful for the moments I have some time alone to myself. It is a gift that I cherish and treasure. It is a gift I try to give to myself every day. 
Time alone to myself is a luxury that I have come to appreciate.

Time alone to myself is a time to reflect on my thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is a time to be present in the moment and appreciate the beauty of life.
It is a time to be grateful for all that I have and all that I am.
It is a time to listen to my inner voice and follow my intuition. It is a time to be true to myself and live authentically. It is a time to be mindful and present in the moment. It is a time to be grateful for the gift of life. 

Time alone to myself is a time to dream, to create, to explore, to learn, to grow, to heal, to love, to forgive, to let go, to be free. It is a time to be me. 
It is a time to be at peace with myself and the world around me.
